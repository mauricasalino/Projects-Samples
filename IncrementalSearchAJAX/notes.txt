//////////// Events //////////////////
--------------------------------------

- Gets highlighted when mouseover
- when keybords event happen
- when result get selected
- when I click outside of it (blur)
- when I click inside of it (focus)

---------------------------------

1- Input Eventhandler (text field)
	- get the current value of the text field
	- if the current value of the text field is an empty string, empty and/or hide the results and end the event handler
	- loop through the countries and build an array containing only the ones that begin with the current value of the text field
	- you can use 'toLowerCase' or 'toUpperCase' on both the country and the value to get case insensitivity
	- 'indexOf' has better compatibility than 'startsWith'
	- if the array of matches contains more than 4, cut it down
	- if the array of matches is empty, insert the "no results" message into the result container element
	- if the array of matches contains one or more, loop through them and create html for each one and insert all of the html into the result  element after the loop

2- Mouseover (individual result elements)
	- remove the highlight class from whatever element has it (if any)
	- add the highlight class to the event target

3- Mousedown (individual result elements)
	- grab the text that is in the event target and set the value of the text field to it
	- empty and/or hide the results container element

4- KeyDown on the (textfield)
	- down arrow (40 key code)
		- if no result element has the highlight class, add the highlight class to the first result element
		- if the result element that has the highlight class is the last one, do nothing
		- if a result element other than the last one has the highlight class, remove the highlight class from the one that has it and add it to the next one
	- up arrow (38 key code) ---------->>>> check bullets !!!
		- if no result element has the highlight class, add the highlight class to the last result element

		- if a result element other than the last one has the highlight class, remove the highlight class from the one that has it and add it to the next one
	- return/enter (13 key code)
		- grab the text contained by the element that has the highlight class (if there is one) and set the value of the text field to it
		- empty and/or hide the results

5- "focus" on the text field

	- do the exact same thing you did for the input event

6- "blur" on the text field
	- empty and/or hide the result container element

	blur happens between mousedown and mouseout
------------------------------
var resultsElem = ''

for (var i = 0; i < matches.length; i++) {
	resultsHtml +=	'<div class='result'>' + matches[i] + '</div>'
}

resultsElem.html(
	resultsHtml
).show();

resultsElem.empty().hide();
---------------------------------

- There's an empty div with the results
<div> search

	<div input>
		<one div for each result>
		<one div for each result>
		<one div for each result>
		<one div for each result>
	<div result>


- for or while loop through array and slice

- .filter() ---> is a loop that array has, you call it and you get a new array with fewer items than the original, it will have as many as many or as fewer as the filter finds
- .map()
- .indexof()
