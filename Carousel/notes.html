To Do List for this project:

1. HTML/CSS stuff
    * A wrapping element containing four kitty elements
    * Kitty elements are position:absolute; so they stack
    on top of each other
    * Kitty elements are width 100% and height 100%
    * wrapping element is height: 600px
    * use background-size: cover or object-fit: cover to get
    the image to fill the container without distortion
    * overflow: hidden on the container so offscreen kitties cannot scrolled to
    * translateX kitties to be off screen to the right (100%)
    * two additional states need to be expressed in CSS: onscreen (translateX(0))
      and offscreen on the right (transform: translateX(-100%)) and offscreen
      on the left (transform: translateX(-100%))
    * for exit and onscreen, transitions are required

    var k = document.getElementByClassName('kitty');

2. JavaScript

var k = document.getElementByClassName('kitty');

      k[0].classList.remove('onscreen');
      k[0].classList.add('exit');
      k[1].classList.add('onscreen');

      * Get List of kitty elements
      * Keep track of the currently onscreen kitty with a
      variable (0 to start)
      * A main animation function
          * removes onscreen class from kitty that has it
          and adds the exit class to it
          * updates the variable keeping track of the current
          * kitty to the next one
          * add onscreen class to the NEW current one
          * 'setTimeOut' to do it again soon

      * event is called "transitionend"
      * a transitionend event handler is required to remove the exit class
      as soon as the kitty is offscreen
          * if you add the transitionendhandler inside the main animation
          function, you need to make sure
          you remove any previous transitionend transitionend handler
          that had been assigned
          *if you use event delegation, you will want to make sure
          you only do your stuff if the transition that ended
          is the one for the kitty with the exit class
      * the best place to 'setTimeOut' again is in the
      transitionend handler


          //ALTERNATIVE JS:
          // document.addEventListener('transitionend', function(e){
          //     if (e.target.classList.contains('exit')) {
          //         e.target.classList.remove('exit');
          //         setTimeout(moveKitties,2000);
          //     }
          // });
