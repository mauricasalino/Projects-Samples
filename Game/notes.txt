if it is string -------> game over

1. reminder - this is an excercise in recursion and working with objects. dont let the node and readline stuff scare you!

2. ask a question to the user

3. when you receive an answer from the user:

* IF IF IF IF IF the user gave us a valid answer
	* If there is another question to ask, then ask it
		* in JS terms, that means if the asnwer the user gave us leads to an object, then theres another question to ask.
	* If there isnt another question to ask, then end the game
* if the user gives us an invalid answer, then we need to scold the user ("bad user!") and ask the question again.

4.
