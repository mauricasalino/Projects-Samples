
STEPS FOR WORKING WITH Handlebars

1. HTML - write the template (that's the <script> we need)
2. HTML - create empty <div> where the template will eventually show up on screen
    * this step dictates WHERE on screen we`ll see the template show up

3. JS -- give handlebars the data it needs to render the template
    * in this case, give handlebars the "response" array I got back from GitHub as a response.

4. JS -- append the template (which now has the data it needs from JS) to the DOM.
    * this step will actually render the template on screen so we can see it.
